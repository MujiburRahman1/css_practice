# CSS Learning Journey 🎨

Welcome to my CSS learning repository!  
This repo includes all my CSS practice files, styling examples, and layout experiments as I learn how to design beautiful web pages.

## 📌 Introduction

Hi, I'm currently learning **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**, which is used to style and design web pages built with HTML.  
I created this repository to keep track of my progress and share my learning with others who want to understand web design.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

- CSS syntax and basic rules  
- Styling text, boxes, colors, and backgrounds  
- Flexbox, Grid, and layouts  
- Responsive design and media queries  
- Mini design projects and templates

## 🌱 Goal

To understand how to design modern, clean, and responsive web pages using CSS — and prepare myself to work with frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS.
